Welcome to the Ford Motor Company Robotics Building! Here, students, staff and faculty work together under one roof to drive the field of robotics toward a future that puts people, not just technology, first. While exploring our new space, weâ€™ve set up a self-guided tour of the highlights around and outside the 134,000-square-foot building, just look for signs like this one!

    content: "<p>A key feature for any robot is safety. As robots and robotic systems become more complex and take on increasingly varied tasks, however, they can fail in unforeseen ways.</p><p>In the Ozay Research Group, autonomous systems, no matter their scope, size, or purpose, are certified to be safe and behave as intended. Can a robot arm safely move to grab an item? Can an autonomous vehicle safely cruise behind another car? Can hundreds of autonomous vehicles safely cross an intersection?</p><p>Researchers in this lab answer questions around how we can trust data, how we can safely operate a system given insufficient, incorrect, or even too much data, and how systems with many moving pieces, from industrial processes to autonomous vehicle networks, can interact safely and securely.</p>"

Here in the Ozay Research Group, autonomous systems, no matter their scope, size, or purpose, are certified to be safe and behave as intended. Researchers in this lab answer questions around how we can trust data, how we can safely operate a system given insufficient, incorrect, or even too much data, and how systems with many moving pieces, from industrial processes to autonomous vehicle networks, can interact safely and securely.

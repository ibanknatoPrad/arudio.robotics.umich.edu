Here in the Ozay Research Group, autonomous systems, no matter their scope, size, or purpose, are certified to be safe and behave as intended. Researchers in this lab answer questions around how we can trust data, how we can safely operate a system given insufficient, incorrect, or even too much data, and how systems with many moving pieces, from industrial processes to autonomous vehicle networks, can interact safely and securely.

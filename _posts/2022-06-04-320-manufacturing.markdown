Advanced manufacturing requires precise control and coordination of multiple systems. In the Barton and Tilbury Research Groups, researchers explore sensing and control to improve upon additive and smart manufacturing, cooperative robotics, and assistive technologies. Such projects include taking 3D printing to nanometer-scale accuracy, utilizing idle manufacturing systems through the cloud, and coordinating multiple robots to explore terrain using the least amount of energy necessary.

This classroom lab space houses the first robotics graduate course students take, ROB 550, which is informally a robot bootcamp. This course gives students the basics in building, programming, and refining the autonomous machines so that they can sense, reason, and act. Projects have included a self-balancing robot, a robot that can navigate a maze on its own, a drone that can pick up and drop off a payload, and a manipulating arm that can stack blocks.

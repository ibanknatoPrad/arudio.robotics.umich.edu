Once robots understand how to grasp objects, what then? The Laboratory for Progress (Perceptive RObotics and Grounded REasoning SystemS) aims to discover methods for computational reasoning and perception that will enable robots to effectively assist people in common human environments. The lab's goal is to make the physical world programmable through robots. This means being able to ask a robot to fold clothes, cook a meal, or clean a room, and the robot successfully understanding the task request, planning the steps to complete it, and executing the steps appropriatelyâ€“even if it makes mistakes along the way.

This space, similar to the Wilson Center across the street, is designed for students on competitive project teams that work on advanced autonomous rovers, boats, aerial systems, exoskeletons and more.

With its connection to the high-bay garages and makerspace, it also offers space for capstone robotics projects and robotics instructional labs.

How can robots successfully interact with the physical world? The Autonomous Robotic Manipulation (ARM) Lab and the Manipulation and Machine Intelligence (MMint) Lab work on developing models and algorithms that allow robots to plan for physical interaction with their environments and manipulate objectsâ€“even notoriously difficult to model soft objects like cloth or rope. Their goal is to develop methods that enable robots to interact with any sort of environment, even ones that the robot has never encountered previously. Their research addresses questions such as: What happens when the robot moves an object? How can the robot sense the effect of its action on an object? How can the robot use its visual and tactile feedback for reasoning and what inspiration can we take from humans?

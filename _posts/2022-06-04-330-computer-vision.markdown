Robots can sense their surroundings in many ways, but how do they make sense of them? Researchers in COG: the Cognitive Robotics Lab create mathematical models and algorithms to capture the information from video and images, such as what objects are in a video, where they are, and what is happening with those objects. This allows machines, such as home-service robots and autonomous vehicles, to better understand what they are seeing and the best way to react.

Michigan Robotics is the first top-ten engineering program to have a robotics department, and with it, one of the first in the country to offer an undergraduate robotics degree. As a pioneer in teaching undergraduate robotics, we are helping to define the curriculum. Primary courses include ROB 101: Computational Linear Algebra, ROB 102: Intro to Programming and AI, ROB 103: Robotics Mechanisms, and ROB 204: Intro to Human-Robot Interaction. From there, students can pursue any number of focuses, diving further into hardware and mechatronics with deeper study of sensors to exploring computing and autonomy with deeper study of operating systems, mapping and navigation.

Michigan also has the unique opportunity to create this curriculum with a priority on both equity and excellence. For this, we have established distributed teaching collaboratives with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority Serving Institutions, teaching these courses in conjunction with faculty from Berea, Morehouse, and Spelman Colleges.

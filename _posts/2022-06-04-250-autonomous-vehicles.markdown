The Field Robotics Group puts robots to the test in unstructured and dynamic environments, across sea, land, air, and space. These environments can introduce extremely noisy data, whether in sensing or communication, requiring complex algorithms to find truth among the signals. In deep water, for example, vision can be hazy and dark, with colors shifted from their normal wavelengths. Developing robot vision and machine learning algorithms, researchers can still utilize such raw data and refine it to achieve their goals, enabling tasks such as autonomous mapping and shipwreck detection underwater, as well as improving autonomous vehicle sensor data on land.

This space combines mechanics and controls to develop advanced prosthetics that improve quality of life for people with limb loss. A movable â€œearthquake platform,"" or it's technical name of a Stewart platform, can tilt in any direction, force-feedback plates measure ground contact and a two-belt variable treadmill enables testing of lower-limb prosthetics.

The glass can turn opaque for privacy during testing.
